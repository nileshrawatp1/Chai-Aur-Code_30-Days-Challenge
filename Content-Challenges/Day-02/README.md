# Day 2: Operators

## Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

### Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${sum}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
```

### Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
let difference = num1 - num2;
console.log(`The difference between ${num1} and ${num2} is ${difference}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The difference between 5 and 3 is 2.
```

### Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
let product = num1 * num2;
console.log(`The product of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${product}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The product of 5 and 3 is 15.
```

### Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 6;
let num2 = 3;
let quotient = num1 / num2;
console.log(`The quotient of ${num1} divided by ${num2} is ${quotient}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The quotient of 6 divided by 3 is 2.
```

### Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 7;
let num2 = 3;
let remainder = num1 % num2;
console.log(
  `The remainder when ${num1} is divided by ${num2} is ${remainder}.`
);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The remainder when 7 is divided by 3 is 1.
```

## Activity 2: Assignment Operators

### Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num = 5;
num += 3;
console.log(`The result after adding 3 to 5 using += is ${num}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The result after adding 3 to 5 using += is 8.
```

### Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num = 5;
num -= 3;
console.log(`The result after subtracting 3 from 5 using -= is ${num}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The result after subtracting 3 from 5 using -= is 2.
```

## Activity 3: Comparison Operators

### Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
console.log(`${num1} > ${num2} is ${num1 > num2}.`);
console.log(`${num1} < ${num2} is ${num1 < num2}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
5 > 3 is true.
5 < 3 is false.
```

### Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 5;
console.log(`${num1} >= ${num2} is ${num1 >= num2}.`);
console.log(`${num1} <= ${num2} is ${num1 <= num2}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
5 >= 5 is true.
5 <= 5 is true.
```

### Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = "5";
console.log(`${num1} == ${num2} is ${num1 == num2}.`);
console.log(`${num1} === ${num2} is ${num1 === num2}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
5 == '5' is true.
5 === '5' is false.
```

## Activity 4: Logical Operators

### Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
let num3 = 7;
console.log(
  `(${num1} > ${num2}) && (${num1} < ${num3}) is ${num1 > num2 && num1 < num3}.`
);
```

**Outcome:**

```
(5 > 3) && (5 < 7) is true.
```

### Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
let num3 = 7;
console.log(
  `(${num1} > ${num2}) || (${num1} > ${num3}) is ${num1 > num2 || num1 > num3}.`
);
```

**Outcome:**

```
(5 > 3) || (5 > 7) is true.
```

### Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 3;
console.log(`!(${num1} < ${num2}) is ${!(num1 < num2)}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
!(5 < 3) is true.
```

## Activity 5: Ternary Operator

### Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

```javascript
let num = -5;
let result = num >= 0 ? "positive" : "negative";
console.log(`The number ${num} is ${result}.`);
```

**Outcome:**

```
The number -5 is negative.
```
